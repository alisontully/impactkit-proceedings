ImpactKit proceedings
=====================

Generate ImpactKit proceedings from individual contributions.
Each individual contribution should be in a folder named `contrib-xx-yy`, where `xx` is a number used for ordering and `yy` a short name for the contribution.
In the folder, there should be an `.md` file and optional `.yaml` files that will be compiled to PDF using `pandoc`.
A barebones template is provided in `contrib-00-template`.
The PDF is compiled using the LaTeX document class (`Tufte-LaTeX`)[https://github.com/Tufte-LaTeX/tufte-latex].


Running it
----------

The python script `makeproc.py` compiles the individual contributions to separate PDF files and them merges them taking into account that each contribution has to start in an odd page.
